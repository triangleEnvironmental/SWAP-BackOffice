</h2>
<p>
    <i><strong>In Short:</strong></i> <i>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</i>
</p>
<p>
    We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.
</p>
<h2>
    6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?
</h2>
<p>
    <i><strong>In Short:</strong></i> <i>If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</i>
</p>
<p>
    Our Services offers you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public on such social media platform.
</p>
<p>
    We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
</p>
<h2>
    7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
</h2>
<p>
    <i><strong>In Short:</strong></i> <i>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</i>
</p>
<p>
    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than six (6) months past the start of idle period of the user's account.
</p>
<p>
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
</p>
<h2>
    8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
</h2>
<p>
    <i><strong>In Short:</strong></i> <i>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</i>
</p>
<p>
    We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
</p>
<h2>

</h2>
<p>
    <i><strong>In Short:</strong></i> <i>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</i>
</p>
<p>
    We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@waste-tracker.com">admin@waste-tracker.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
</h2>
<p>
    <i><strong>In Short:</strong></i> <i>You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</i>

You can find their contact details here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a> .

</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Cookies and similar technologies:</u></strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. To opt-out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Opting out of email marketing:</u></strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Access your account settings and update your preferences.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
</h2>
<p>
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
</p>
<h2>
    12. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?
</h2>
<p>
    <i><strong>In Short:</strong></i> <i>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</i>
</p>
<p>
    California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.

<p>
    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
</p>
<p>
    We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
